# Sofware-University-Java-Dev-All-Exercises

This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS project.

This repository has the purpose of storing all of my Sofware University exercises.

Some time has passed after completing my courses, and during them, i did not do every exercise because they simply took a lot of time.
My current mission is to go through all excercises with the ideas of 
  1. Remembering my Java knowledge
  2. Exercising my Java skills
  3. Having present code for potential work.

These exercises are coded under the JetBrains IntelliJ Student License IDE.

Ideally, the condition of every exercise should be present in all modules in the commented header.
The documents containing the exercises on each topic should also be added eventually under every folder.

This is a single Project with multiple directories, matching up with the courses/lessons and every excercise is a separate module.
